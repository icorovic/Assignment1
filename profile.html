	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The reslt of the three tests i completed can be found on the below links.
	<ul><p>

	<p style="margin-left: 40px">Looking at the results of the three tests, I can say they are correct in terms of how I learn and process information. The Myers-Briggs test was the most relevant in describing me. The results of these test validate my methods of learning new information. Test like these provide a unique insight into the individuals approach to problem resolution which in turn can be used to better manage ourselves knowing strengths and weaknesses.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The results have highlighted my strengths and weaknesses which is not something I think about daily since I am generally thinking about the best way to resolve the problem at hand. This is the first time I did one of these tests and the results have provided me with an insight on what areas I am good at and where I can use more help. Overall the tests have provided me with information which I will use to push myself to do better in the areas where I scored low. Being in a team environment, I will know my boundaries and be able to better manage the workflow and communication with team members.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">When forming a team, I can use the information from the test to better assign tasks with team members. For example, I prefer working alone on a task so I would be happy to take a section of the group assignment to work on it and alone and present it to the group when I complete it. It is beneficial for team members to know everyoneâ€™s strengths and weaknesses as this will allow the team to function better.</p>
