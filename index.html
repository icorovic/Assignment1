						<h2>A brief history of Igor.</h2>
						<p>Born in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia in 1984 i lived a happy life then at 9 years the war unfolded and through many refugee camps, my parents, sister and I somehow ended up in Australia. I speak Serbian but after the war everyone has a variation of Serbian as their language so technically, in addition to Serbian i speak Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin.</p>

						<h2>Interests and likes...</h2>
							
								<p>Technology has been one of my interests since i was 11 years old. I love building systems and troubleshooting software. Whn i am not in front of a computer you will find me somewhere in the world with my camera creating beautiful pictures.</p>

								<h2> What i like about IT?</h2>
								
								<p> IT is one of the key areas of human evolvement which affects the whole world and enables new opportunities on every aspect of our lives. I love troubleshooting and analysing business processes so i am able to reccommend a suitable product to improve the workflow. IT is interesting for me as it never stays the same, there is always something new everyday. I have been fortunate enough to work in an agency which is supportive of my career goals and allowed me to work in different areas of IT as well as in the agency which helped me understand the end user requirements and at the same time the IT department. I think IT is one of the few areas of todays world which chages rapidly with no sign of slowing down. Now, I have decided is the time to seek further education in order to broaden my understanding of the various IT areas and the RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology is the right study to enable me to do that. Down the track i see myself being involved with drones or cyber security.
