	<center><h1>Project Idea<h1></center>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Overview</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">I have an idea to build an app which would enable employees to “check-in” during building emergency situations. If there is a fire, building collapse or terrorist attack how do you know who made it out of the building or who is still trapped in the building or who is across the city unaware of the commotion? The app would enable employees to “check-in” or “request help”, quickly notifying the Chief Fire Warden or emergency services if there is anyone unaccounted for. </p>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Motivation</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The threat of terrorism is ever rising in Australia. Since 2014 there have been six terrorist incidents in Australia. During the evacuation of buildings, it is near impossible to know for sure who is out and who may be in danger. Being able to identify staff who are unaccounted for and knowing what floor their office was on emergency services would be in possession of the possible location of the perpetrator as well as having positive identification of the staff members who are missing which could in a critical moment save hostage lives.</p>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Description</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The app needs to be available on mobile devices and desktop app stores. To keep the app simple, the end user (staff) will only have the option to upload a headshot of themselves and check information synced to the app from corporate servers. All the data needs to be stored in Australia to protect data sovereignty. The app needs to have an application programming interface (API) to link into the client’s active directory (AD) so that only staff who work at that company can sign in using their work credentials. Other options such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services will also be available, so the app has flexibility in connecting with client systems. The administrator will be able to activate the “check-in” function in emergency situations and be able to include a short message which will send out a push notification to all the staff requesting they “check-in”. The “check-in” function will offer two responses “OK” or NOT OK”. Should the “NOT OK” option be triggered app will give users ability to write a short message or activate the camera which will stream audio and video indefinitely even if the phone is locked.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px"> If the app detects data transfer is not strong enough to maintain good video bitrate it will terminate video and stream audio. In the event the phone battery is below 20% the app will cease video stream and continue with audio. Administrator will immediately get a report on the number of mobile devices reached and the responses. Staff will have the ability to send a short message back. Should the building have swipe card access, the app will have ability to draw data from swipe card system so it can cross reference who swiped in but did not respond to the requested “check-in” request. Using information from the phone directory emergency services will be able to pinpoint the staff work floor and from colleagues the location of the staff members desk. This will greatly reduce the time taken to identify who needs assistance and their possible location. Emergency Services in each state will be given master access to the app so they are able to login and filter by building address which will enable them to trigger the “check-in” feature or view the statistics of the “check-in” status in the event of an emergency. As the primary design of this app is to be used in buildings, there is no need to request user GPS location which will reduce privacy issues people might have.</p>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Tools and Technologies</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">This app will live in the cloud so hosting will be sourced from one of the Australian Signals Directorate approved providers. Each company has different systems so it will be challenging to enable data flow to the app. Swift programming language can be used to design the app for Apple devices and Android Studio to create the app for Android devices. Amazon Web Services would be used to host data in Australia. Security expertise would also be sought to ensure the app is well protected and robust to malicious acts. Access would be restricted to Australian IP addresses.</p>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Skills Required</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">The skills required for this app include a web programmer to develop the website, Android developer, Apple software developer, security expert to ensure data is secure and encrypted while in transit, cloud specialist to configure app access and someone who knows what current plugins are available which could be used in order for the app to work with various corporate systems. I believe skilled people would be able to be located however, there might be issues in finding the right people to configure access with legacy systems some building sites use.</p>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Outcome</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">If this project were to be successful, emergency services would have information available to them in real time in some cases even before they arrive on the scene. It would allow greater situational awareness during times of crisis for both the staff working in the building affected and the emergency services who are dealing with the incident. This service would have positive impact on staff security and the employer’s duty of care towards staff during an incident would be easier to manage knowing everyone was safe.</p>
