			<h2 style="margin-left: 40px">My Ideal Job</h2>

		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> The link for the job i see myself in, is on <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39227672?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=0b603bab-3ac7-4fb7-9bc8-753d14a682d8">Seek</a> and the PFD version of the advertisement can be located by clicking <a href="docs\jobadvert.pdf">here</a>.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 40px">This position is appealing to me because it would enable me to build on the current IT capability of the organisation to ensure it is competitive and constantly evolving with the cahangeing technology. BHP being a large organisation would enable me to challenge myself and my team on many aspects of the business which in turm would provide new opportunities to further my career.<p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">The qualification required for this job are quite high given my current qualifications.  Being the head of Technology Strategy, there is certanly a requirement to have held senior IT positions previously. As with any job in a specialised area such as IT there is a requirement to hold formal qualifications. The job advertisement requires Science, Technology and Mathematics (STEM) Qualification, which is basically a formal qualification in any of the four areas. I would also need to gain more experiance managing IT functions and expand my knowledge of Infrastructure and application environments. The remaining requirements i have experiance in.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">My current qualificaions (Diploma in Justice Administration, Adv Diploma of Governement, Adv Diploma in Management) are more prevelant in business planning, management and human resources than IT. Since 2009 i have been working in a corporate environment which has enabled me to gain valuable knowledge such as how to handle difficult people and strategically plan work priorities and successful outcomes. IT has always been an interest for me and now I have obviously decided to pursue that interest further. While i have no qualifications in IT, I have been working in the IT client support area and have made decisions on IT hardware procurement activities for my department.<p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">My immediate goal is to finish the Bachelor of Information Technology. During this time my aim is to move into an IT department which will enable me to gain experiance on a wide range of different areas within IT. Following the completion of the Bachelor degree my intention is to complete complete a Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security as this is a very important part of IT and will further diversify my qualifications. I will aslo complete the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) course which will give me the understanding of the framework used to balance the needs of the organisation with the capability and provision of IT services offered. I beleive a mixture of the mentioned formal qualifications and work experiance will enable me to achieve the required status to be successful in a job such as this one in the future.</p>
